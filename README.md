# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone. Tweeter is a better alternative as there is no weirdness going on, no toxicity, and it's all about having fun!

## Getting Started

2. Start the web server using the `npm run local` command. The app will be served at <http://localhost:8080/>.
3. Tune into <http://localhost:8080/> in your browser and tweet away!

## Dependencies

- Express
- Node 5.10.x or above
- body-parser

## How To Use

Have something witty to say? Or have some weird shower thoughts to share? No worries! Simply click the down arrow on the top right side of the page. Once the form shows up, start your what's on your mind!

If you have nothing to share and are simply feeling curious about what other people are up to, scroll down through your timeline to see what everybody else is tweeting. Simple as that!
