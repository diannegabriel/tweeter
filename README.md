# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone. Tweeter is a better alternative as there is no weirdness going on, no toxicity, and it's all about having fun!

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies using the `npm install` command.
2. Start the web server using the `npm run local` command. The app will be served at <http://localhost:8080/>.
3. Tune into <http://localhost:8080/> in your browser and tweet away!
